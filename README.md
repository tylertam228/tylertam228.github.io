# Tiger228 Personal Website

This is my personal website (portfolio) hosted on GitHub Pages. I try my best to make it clean, fast, and cool with a HUD-style animation.

Built with HTML, CSS and a little JavaScript.

## Skills
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- Game development interest (HUD-style UI, interactive animation)
